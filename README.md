# Clothing-Recommendation-System
This is a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system for weather-based clothing recommendations using four input variables (temperature, wind speed, humidity, and rain probability) to suggest appropriate attire categories (Cold, Normal, Warm, or Rain Wear).

Two implementations were compared: triangular membership functions with centroid defuzzification achieved 90% accuracy, while the trapezoidal- Gaussian with MOM defuzzification reached 80% accuracy. The system's 17-rule knowledge base was fine-tuned through iterative testing of different membership functions, rule weights, and defuzzification methods. Performance evaluation demonstrated contextually appropriate recommendations across diverse weather scenarios, with particular effectiveness in extreme conditions. The research demonstrates how fuzzy logic can effectively model inherently subjective human decision-making, concluding that triangular membership functions with centroid defuzzification offer the optimal balance between accuracy and user experience despite higher computational requirements.

This research develops a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system that emulates human reasoning for clothing selection based on four environmental parameters: temperature, wind speed, humidity, and rain probability. The system aims to provide contextually appropriate clothing recommendations that account for the complex interplay between these weather variables. Unlike crisp classification methods, the fuzzy approach allows for smoother transitions between clothing categories and better handles the inherent uncertainty in weather-based decision-making. This report also analyzes the performance and characteristics of different fuzzy logic implementations for a weather-based clothing recommendation system. The system aims to suggest appropriate clothing options (Cold Wear, Normal Wear, Rain Wear, or Warm Wear) based on four input variables: temperature (Â°C), wind speed, humidity (%), and rain probability. The two implementations differ in their choice of: 1. Membership functions (MFs): Triangular vs. Trapezoidal/Gaussian 2. Defuzzification methods: Centroid vs. Mean of Maximum (MOM) These design choices significantly impact the system's responsiveness and accuracy in different weather scenarios. The report details the system architecture, including input/output variables, membership function design, rule formulation, and defuzzification techniques. It also presents a systematic analysis of system performance under various weather scenarios and explores the effects of different fuzzy inference parameters on recommendation quality.
